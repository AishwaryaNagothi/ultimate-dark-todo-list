## 🧠 My Learning Experience

Building this project helped me strengthen my understanding of **frontend web development**.  
I gained hands-on experience with:

- Structuring responsive layouts using **HTML5**
- Creating modern UI designs using **CSS3** (glassmorphism, gradients, animations)
- Implementing application logic using **JavaScript**
- Using **Local Storage** for data persistence
- Working with **Git & GitHub** for version control
- Deploying a live project using **Netlify**

This project improved my problem-solving skills and gave me confidence in building real-world web applications.
